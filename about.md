# Work

I write software and manage servers for [Educate the Wait][etw], a digital
signage company. Most of my work involves working with ColdFusion, rewriting
Python 2 code to Python 3, and designing our new dashboard. I'm also working
on introducing a new API to allow third party clients to be able to interact
with our database and software.

# Professional

In my spare time at work, I'm helping [Hashbang, Inc.][hashbang] with various
projects and making sure that I'm up to date on technology that people are
using as "industry standard". I've been doing some work on some various related
projects, such as the [#!book][book], which is an educational resource for
learning more information about security, privacy, and decentralized services.

# Personal

I've written and deployed [a few things][things] personally though, so I'd be
honored if you'd like to check them out or tinker around with them a bit, as
I often don't have time to work on them or promote them as much as I'd like.
I write a lot of stuff in Python, like web apps or post-processing hooks for
software like Educate the Wait or otherwise. I also write some stuff in Lua,
such as various chat bots and other experimental kinds of software that I've
been using to learn about things.
