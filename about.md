I write software for a company called [mediaPanel][mediapanel-website]. I also
do tech support for mediaPanel, as well as set up the hardware. When I'm not
busy working on something, I like to do some reading - about security, about
new technology, and about automation. I find these subjects fascinating, but
I find a lot of common misconceptions about things, so I am making a blog to
discuss my thoughts on the subject.

I've written and deployed [a few things][things] in my time, though, so I'd be
honored if you'd like to check them out or tinker around with them a bit, as
I often don't have time to work on them or promote them as much as I'd like.
I write a lot of stuff in Python, like web apps or post-processing hooks for
software like mediaPanel or otherwise. I also write some stuff for Lua, such
as a [cookies][lua-http-pr-93] library for [lua-http][lua-http-github]. Some
other languages I know are: JS, CSS, & HTML, UNIX Shell, C, and bits of C++,
Rust, and Ruby.

This blog is rendered using [Jekyll][jekyll-organization].
